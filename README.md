**Python Tkinter Project | DSA Showcase**

## **Description**

It is a **Python Tkinter project** demonstrating the practical use of **Queue (FIFO)** for pending orders and **Stack (LIFO)** for recently served orders. It’s a **showcase project** to highlight how core **DSA concepts** can be applied in a GUI-based application.

## **Features**

* Add new customer orders with items
* Serve next order (FIFO) and track recently served orders (LIFO)
* Undo last served order
* Export order history as a report (CSV)
* Dark/Light mode toggle
* Toast notifications for actions (success, info, warning, error)
* Dynamic button states based on available data

## **Tech Stack**

* **Python**
* **Tkinter** for GUI
* **Queue & Stack** for core logic

## **DSA Showcase**

* **Queue (FIFO):** Manages pending orders
* **Stack (LIFO):** Tracks recently served orders and enables undo

## **Usage**

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhishek-2006/orderflow.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd orderflow
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

4. Interact with the interface: add orders, serve, undo, clear, and export reports.
